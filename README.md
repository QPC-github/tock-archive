Tock Archive
============

This repository stores code that was in the mainline Tock repo, but is no longer
supported. Using `cargo`, the code should still compile and be usable, but will
likely no longer be updated.

Code can be moved for a variety of reasons, but it is likely that code was moved
because it was not actively being used and development stopped. Tock roughly
operates with an "accept quickly and archive aggressively" attitude towards
new contributions to try to balance growth with development and maintenance
overhead. If the code in this repo is helpful to you, and you want to develop
it further, mainline Tock is receptive of re-introducing it with new updates.
